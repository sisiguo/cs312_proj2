# What is the problem?
We will implement the 2048 game. It is 4x4 tile grid game where the goal is to sum up tiles of powers of 2 by moving all tiles either up, down, left, or right. You win the game when you get a 2048 tile.

# What is the something extra?
- We will implement a visual representation of the state of the game in the console rather than it being purely text-based. At every user action, we will output a new visual representation of the state of the game to give the user a more interactive experience.

- We will implement different difficulty levels of the game: the easiest level has an unlimited number of moves. As the level increases, the number of moves is increasingly restricted.

- We will add a number of moves counter.

# What did we learn from doing this?
(This should be written after you have done the work.) What is the bottom-line? Is logic programming suitable for (part-of) the task? Make sure you include the evidence for your claims.
